Communication
=============

Communication is the backbone of any organization. We have several channels with different purposes. Below are the channels of communication we use in order of preference.


GitHub
------

Most communication is done through GitHub through its issue trackers. Each project has an issue tracker that should be used to request/propose/discuss features, practices, and policies; report bugs; and ask questions. Likewise we use pull-requests to discuss and review implementation. We prefer these lines of communication as they provide a history of discussions around specific topics. So, whenever possible, use these channels.


Gitter
------

**TODO: We currently use Slack. But it is on it's way out. We are currently trying
to pick a new chat system. We were leaning toward Gitter. But this is still
up in the air.**

Of course, you may not know where the best place to post something is, or you wonder if you should even post anything at all. And in such cases, you may not feel comfortable posting an issue asking "is this the right place for ___ ?" In those cases, you can jump onto one of our Gitter channels and chat with someone. Gitter can also be used for impromptu meetings, help sessions, or just socializing. Also Gitter makes it easy to refer to objects in GitHub by using its auto-linking syntax. If you do discuss an issue on Gitter, please consider summarizing the results of your conversation on a relevant issue so that it can be easily found later. However you use Gitter, just remember these channels are public and have a permanent history.
